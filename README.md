# Jaglavak Test Data

This is a submodule of https://github.com/StuartRiffle/Jaglavak, which is a chess engine based on [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) (MCTS).

It holds data used for testing and training: test suites, opening books, game records, etc. 

These files are huge, and are not needed for a normal build of Jaglavak.
